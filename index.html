    <h2>My history of coding</h2>
    <div class="coding-history">
    <p>I started coding when I was 8 years old when my parents ask me if I wanted to start coding. I thought that coding was hard, but yes it was hard when I started. But the more I practised the easier it became. I was in a company called earlycamp. Earlycamp was a company which teach young children how to program.I was one of the first students to join. The teacher was called Frank Tamre. We used to go to ilab or nilab every saturday.</p>
    <p>When I first joined, I started with some simple games which you place blocks as comands so the player can move. Then I went to scratch where I learnt a little about game development and then I started learning HTML. After HTML, I went to CSS, then Bootsrap, then javascript. Then I started learning python early 2020 and here I am, still learning python(2020)</p>
